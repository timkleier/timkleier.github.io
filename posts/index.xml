            <description>An API gateway with microservices is a common pattern for enterprise architectures. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore this pattern for an eCommerce enterprise, implementing a gateway API that directs traffic to a product catalog service and a product inventory service. The gateway application, utilizing FusionAuth, functions as a centralized authentication mechanism. The microservices, with authorization passed to them from the gateway, implement distributed authorization.

            <description>Versioning an API is not as simple as it might seem. Many software developers don&amp;rsquo;t understand the importance of being aware of data contracts and breaking changes until something breaks in production. But there are ways to effectively version your APIs that don&amp;rsquo;t lead to frustrated consumers or developers. I explore these approaches in this article on freeCodeCamp /news.

            <description>A popular mantra in Agile Methodology is to use &amp;ldquo;vertical slices&amp;rdquo;, delivering full stack pieces of software functionality. This Medium article will leave you thinking about the merits of horizontal slices as well, and perhaps thinking about eating a piece of layer cake.
