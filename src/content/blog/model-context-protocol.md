This four-part series through [Gun.io](https://www.gun.io) explores how Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridges the gap between large language models (LLMs) and real-world systems. If you’re building with AI—or just trying to make your software more intelligent—MCP offers a lightweight, standards-based way to expose your existing tools and APIs to natural language interfaces.

In Part 1, [Model Context Protocol: The Missing Layer Between AI and Your Apps](https://gun.io/ai/2025/05/model-context-protocol-mcp-introduction/), we introduce MCP through a real-world scenario where an executive queries multiple systems by voice while out for a run. The article lays the foundation for how LLMs can take structured actions in real systems.

In Part 2, [Wrapping an Existing API with MCP: How to Expose Your Current APIs to LLMs](https://gun.io/news/2025/05/wrap-existing-api-with-mcp/), we walk through how to make an existing API—like a support ticket system—LLM-friendly by defining it as a tool. With just a few lines of code, your endpoints become accessible via plain-language prompts.

In Part 3, [Building a Standalone MCP Server](https://gun.io/news/2025/06/mcp-server-legacy-database-ai-integration/), we walk through how to build a standalone server using MCP. Instead of wrapping an existing API, you'll define purpose-built tools and serve them directly to large language models.

In Part 4, [Creating Business Workflows with LLMs and MCP (Coming Soon)](), we go a step further and show how to compose tools into intelligent workflows that automate tasks across your stack, from CRMs to calendars.
